# Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains the code submitted for the Housing Price Prediction competition on Kaggle. The project was completed as part of the "Intro to Machine Learning" course on Kaggle Learn.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to predict the sale prices of houses using various features provided in the dataset. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Files

- `housing_price_prediction.py`: The main Python script containing all the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset

Download the dataset from the [Kaggle Housing Prices Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) and place the files in the same directory as `housing_price_prediction.py`.

### Running the Code

Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python housing_price_prediction.py
```

This will preprocess the data, train the model, and generate predictions for the test set.

## Results

The predictions will be saved in a file named `submission.csv`, which can be uploaded to Kaggle for evaluation.
